This repository is organized into three different sections. The behavioral assay folder contains all code needed to run and maintain the behavioral assay used to collect our olfactory search data. The analysis folder contains all code used to analyze data for the figures in our eLife behavior paper. Finally, the ARHMM-code folder contains custom code used to run the autoregressive Hidden Markov Model on tracking data to identify common motifs of behavior in our search task.
