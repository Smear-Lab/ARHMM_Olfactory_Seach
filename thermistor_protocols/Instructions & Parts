Note: As of earlier this year, these pins no longer mate well with each other...however, we have found that if you clip the ends off the pins, you can get them to mate well enough for freely moving recordings. Happy to discuss this further when you get to this point â€“ we have a few alternative pin options in the lab now. 

I cut end of the thermistor wire to a couple cm from the glass bead (just enough to reach pins between the ears) and separate/strip the individual wires at the end with a razor blade. I then solder those wires into two of the gold-hole pins referenced above (the pins will come in a strip, just clip them so you have a block of 2 at a time).

SURGERY

We implant the thermistor bead by drilling a hole in the nasal bone but leaving the underlying epithelium intact. Please contact for further information/guidance on surgical implantation. After setting the bead in the hole using super glue, we simply glue the pins anywhere on the implant that you can reach them/they will be out of the way and encase the wire in vet bond/glue/dental cement/your medium of choice for implants.

COMMUTATOR/WIRE (for free moving recordings)

Commutator:

The wire is important as you want something stiff enough that it doesn't twist, but also small so it's not cumbersome. This is my favorite commutator wire. I just solder this onto two pins of the gold-hole thermistor pins (see above) to plug into the mouse: https://www.amazon.com/B-30-1000-30AWG-Plated-Copper-Wrepping/dp/B008AGUDEY/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=P%2FN+B-30-1000+30AWG+Tin+Plated+Copper+Wire+Wrepping+Cable+Reel+Black&qid=1561142706&s=gateway&sr=8-1

AMPLIFICATION

I built my own little cheap amplifier to record from the thermistors that is tailored to them. Included are the amplifier circuit, a screenshot of the circuit I adapted, and the PCBExpress file of the design that I used to order my boards. Also here's a link to the op-amp I used: https://www.adafruit.com/product/808.
