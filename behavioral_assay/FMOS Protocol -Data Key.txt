DATA KEY FOR FMOS BEHAVIORAL ASSAY 

This key represents how data is saved through the programs available on this github project. At the end of our project, this dataset was reformatted for publishing on DRYAD (doi:10.5061/dryad.r7sqv9sc0). Therefore, our analysis code will not read the below format properly as the directories/data tables are slightly different. You may reformat according to the published dataset or contact us directly for information and our code that standardizes the dataset and makes it readable for our data analysis/visualization programs.  

DATAPATH
Data is separated by subject. Inside each subject folder are sub-folders for training or experimental condition (i.e. 100-0, 80-20, 60-40, interleaved, trainer1, trainer2, etc.). Inside each condition folder is every session run in that condition. Each session folder contains the files below. One example datapath to these files could be: 

Dropbox/data/Mouse_2054/80-20/2/

This would mean subject #2054 in the 80-20 condition in his 2nd session of running. 

FILE TYPES
tracking coordinates (continuous sampling at 80 Hz)
comx.dat = center of mass x-coordinate 
comy.dat = center of mass y-coordinate  
headx.dat = head x-coordinate 
heady.dat = head y-coordinate 
nosex.dat = nose x-coordinate 
nosey.dat = nose y-coordinate 
timestamp.dat = timestamp of video frame 

sniff & nose poke signals
NP.dat = nose poke status (see key below) 
sniff.dat = sniff signal

information files
timestamp.txt = timestamp beginning of session
videolocation.txt = name of raw video file in system hard drive for easy location
notes.txt = session summary 
trialsummary.txt = a description of each trial in the session 

extraneous information
LFV.dat = left odor valve on/off - DO NOT USE (not set up yet)
RFV.dat = right odor valve on/off - DO NOT USE (not set up yet) 

DATA KEYS & INFORMATION
sniff & nose poke signals
Sniff signal is output in arbitrary Arduino units that directly correspond with voltage output from an amplifier. 

information files
Timestamp format: year – month – day T hour – minute – second 

Notes File
This file gives you general information about the session. It has presets in fmos_preferences, but the actual function for saving the notes file is in fmos_datamgt and can be customized to include whatever information you would like. 

Trial Summary File
This file is organized with variables sorted by columns and trials sorted by row with a “,” as the delimiter. Each row will provide you the following information for one trial: 

trial #, condition, active odor valve, response, trial start time (s), trial end time (s), dilution of odorant in odor vial

NUMERICAL VARIABLE KEYS
Nose poke signal
 0 = no poke, 1 = right poke, 2 = left poke, 3 = initiation port poke
Condition
0 = 100-0, 1 = 80-20, 2 = 60-40, 3 = control
Active valve
1 = right odor valve, 2 = left odor valve
Response
1 = correct, 0 = incorrect
